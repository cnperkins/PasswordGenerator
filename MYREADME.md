Name: Password Generator
Description: Generates a random password with a mix of what the user chooses. The user can choose the length of characters, upper, lowercase, numbers or special characters.
These options are displayed through prompts and alerts.
I am not able to complete this project due to me not understanding how to make this work. I requested a tutor and I'm waiting for the first session. I hope to come back to this and make the code work.
